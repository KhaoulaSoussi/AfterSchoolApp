# AfterSchoolApp

## Description
AfterSchoolApp is a website built to manage a tutoring center. It offers the users (teachers, students, and admins) an interface to perform most transactions effortlessly. First, admins can add new students and new teachers to the center. Second, teachers are provided with an interface through which they can view their profile, view their upcoming sessions, add availabilities, and view the list of offered courses. And finally, students can view their profile, the history of sessions they attended, and they can of course request a session from a teacher based on attributes including the level, the subject, and the session type (individual or group session).

## Purpose
The main purpose of this project is for us to learn how to connect a database to a website. Therefore, the main focus was not put on the frontend but more on the backend. 

## What is done and what needs to be done
The time that was allocated to the implementation of this project (less than two weeks) was not sufficient to finish all the interfaces. While we could not implement the backend for the admin interface, we fully implemented the addition of availabilities for the teacher's interface (FE and BE), and we fully implemented the addition of sessions for the student's interface (FE and BE).

## Technologies used
- Jakarta Server Pages (JSP)
- JQuery
- Java Servlet
- JavaScript
- PostgreSQL
